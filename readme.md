# CSCS Knowledge Base Markdown Proof-of-Concept

This is a proof of concept of using MKDocs for the CSCS Knowledge Base.

Open source documentation that everybody can contribute to.

The generated documentation can be viewed here: [bcummig.github.io/kb-poc](https://bcumming.github.io/kb-poc/)

## Getting Started

Clone this repository on your PC/laptop, then create a Python venv that provides the tools required to build and review the documentation locally.

This step only needs to be run once, when the repository is cloned
```bash
# run once to install all of the tools needed to build and view the site locally
./setup
```

To view the documentation, run the `serve` script:
```bash
# run every time you wish to view the documentation
./serve
```

This generates the documentation locally, which can be viewed using a local link, typically [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
