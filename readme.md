# CSCS Knowledge Base Markdown Proof-of-Concept

This is a proof of concept of using MKDocs for the CSCS Knowledge Base.

## Objectives

Ease of deployment:
* easy to make small edits and changes
* easy to preview your changes before deploying them
* easy to deploy straight away for small changes
* easy to request a review

Search:
* search should just work
* integration of LLM chat bot for answering questions based on docs
* generate links to KB docs on service desk tickets

Front page:
* A custom front page that shows "cards", like the ones on the [Material documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) or our [Confluence based KB](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
