There are different ways to authenticate your identity in order to access services at CSCS, using a password set by the user. Currently users can be authenticated with:

* Classic ssh with CSCS username/password, and also with ssh-keys
* CSCS username/password on different web services. Sessions can be independent from each other so, signing into one service does not necessarily sign the user into another one
* CSCS username/password on a Single Sign-On gate, which once the user is authenticated, can move between services (connected to this gate) without signing in again
* Username/password from an external institution, provided that his/her CSCS account has been "linked" to that external identity beforehand and the service uses the Single Sign-On gate
