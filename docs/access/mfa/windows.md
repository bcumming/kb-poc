    copy over the MFA with windows docs from [Confluence](https://confluence.cscs.ch/display/KB/Connecting+to+CSCS+systems+through+MFA+on+Windows).

    the windows docs are pretty terrible, and they just repeat the same steps as the main docs, but in WSL or MobaXterm.
    Can't we just have a helpful expandable tab in the main docs that says "use WSL on windows"?

    The workarounds for MobaXterm issues etc. can be added to the "common problems" list
