# Building and Installing Software

CSCS provides commonly used software and tools on Alps, however many use cases will require first installing software on a system before you can start working.

Modern HPC applications and software stacks are often very complicated, and there is no one-size-fits-all method for building and installning them.

## Programming environments

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :fontawesome-solid-earth-americas: __[uenv]__ – uenv provide isolated software environments
- :fontawesome-solid-earth-americas: __[CPE]__ – use the Cray Programming Environment

</div>

  [uenv]: uenv.md
  [CPE]: cray-programmin-environment.md

## Python

There are multiple ways to install Python software.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :fontawesome-brands-python: __[pip]__ – create a virtual environment using python in a uenv
- :fontawesome-brands-python: __[conda]__ – use conda

</div>

  [pip]: uenv.md
  [conda]: cray-programmin-environment.md
