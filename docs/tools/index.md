## Debugging tools

Debugging is an essential part of developing and running scientific parallel
applications, especially in a high-performance computing (HPC) environment.
Efficient debugging tools can significantly improve your workflow and save
valuable computational resources.

On CSCS HPC platforms, you have access to a range of powerful debugging tools
tailored for parallel and distributed applications. These tools can help you
diagnose issues and verify the correctness of your code - whether you are using
MPI, OpenMP, or hybrid programming models.

Learning to debug effectively is crucial will not only help you quickly resolve
issues but also build a deeper understanding of how your code interacts with
the underlying hardware. In this section we’ll introduce you to the various
debugging solutions available at CSCS. If you have issues or questions about
debugging tools, please do not hesitate to contact us on support.cscs.ch.
