    A description of the MLP

    * who are the users (help answer the question "is this the platform that I am on")
    * who are the partners (SwissAI, etc)
    * how to get apply to access MLp (if that is a thing)

## Getting Started


### Onboarding users

Project administrators (PIs and deputy PIs) of projects on the MLp can to invite users to join their project, before they can use the project's resources on Alps.
This is performed using the [project managemant tool](../access/waldur.md).

!!! note
    The MLp uses a different project management tool than the old UMP tool used for the other platforms.
    In the future, the new tool will replace the UMP tool on other platforms.
