# Alps Infrastructure

Alps is a general-purpose compute and data Research Infrastructure (RI) open to the broad community of researchers in Switzerland and the rest of the world. Alps will provide a high impact, challenging and innovative RI that will allow Switzerland to advance science and impact society.

Alps enables the creation of versatile clusters (vClusters) that can be tailored to the specific needs of users while maintaining confidentiality. For example, a vCluster will be dedicated to MeteoSwissâ€™ numerical weather forecasts, another one to the User Lab and another one to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
